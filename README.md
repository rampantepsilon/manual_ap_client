# Manual Archipelago Web Client
Electron client for Manual Archipelago worlds. (Replacement for the Manual AP Client)

## One Client to Rule Them All!
I built this client because while I have nothing against the Manual AP Client built from python. I wanted to build something that could also be ran on other devices without much overhead.

This project doesn't use anything major in terms of design or function. Also, if you wanted to webhost this you can move the files from src/ to your host and it should work right out of the box.

### Builds
Until this is in a near perfect state (i.e. Beta build earliest), there will only be a Windows release built as that is the system I'm currently testing on. Once completed, there will be MacOS and Linux builds as well as a web version for mobile users.

This project is aimed to be a goto for anyone playing Archipelagos with others.

### Versioning for this app
Versioning will follow the current AP release. However, there will be different builds as the app is developed. This is so that users will know what version of the AP server this will be compatible with.
